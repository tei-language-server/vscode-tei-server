# vscode-tei-server (WiP currently none working)
https://tei-c.org/ Language Server for vscode

## Why?
There is a hugh effort World wide to create Digital Editions of Existing Text there is a Formart Called TEI that gets used in research and it has no language server.


## What does it do?
It will treat your workspace or folder as project as soon as you add .teiconfig.json or teiconfig.json to your project 
It will follow the same Project Parsing algorythm that typescript uses internal but it will work with XML Documents
